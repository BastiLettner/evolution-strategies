# evolution-strategies
Ray-based implementation of Evolution Strategies (OpenAI).
Not restricted to Neural Networks and OpenAI Gym Interface.
Uses fitness object to represent objective function.

## Main Interface

The interface between this implementation and your objective function looks like this:

```python
reward = fitness.evaluate(params)
```

In this call `params` is a sample solution, generated by the Evolution Strategies (ES) Algorithm.
It has the form of a flat array with specified fixed size.
The params can be interpreted as required (e.g. the parameters of a neural network).
The reward is the value which ES is going to maximize.

## How to run

First, install the requirements:

```
pip install -e setup.py
```

Since the implementation is ray based it requires a ray cluster.
The example shows how to run the algorithm for a simple function on a single node.
